# PHP Apache Template
A starter pack my favorite .htaccess config and directory structure.

All requests for php files, directories, or sensitive files
are redirected to the public/index.php.

An additional .htaccess file and index.php in outside the public folder
ensure all requests will still land inside your projects
public folder in case your hosting provider forces you to
put your entire project source code in a public html folder.

The php files are minimal entry point and use php7+ features.
